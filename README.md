# svelte.app

A directory of real world examplesites written using svelte

This is the code that powers [svelte.app](https://svelte.app).

## Submit an app

If you have made an example app, feel free to send in a PR or
open an issue with details to add it.
If you're doing a PR, you'll need to add it to `apps.json` file
in the root directory alongside an image into `assets/sites`
matching the dimensions of the others.

I'll be happy to host the example and/or make it available as a subdomain under `svelte.app`.

## Testing Locally

We're using sapper, so its as simple as doing `npm run dev` to get started.
